Presentation Notes:

Group 1:
-looked at learning styles column and where did you gain experience in programming languages
-used python to clean the data
-used R to fully clean the data so it could be analyzed 
-looked at the summary data of learning styles, found out that there does not appear to be a preference of learning style. -found out that class in interested in collaborative data science
-biggest takeaway: some people are comfortable being specialists and others prefer to be generalists

Group 2:
-wanted to see how learning styles correlated with group roles
-eliminated students that did not provide their 4 learning scores
-everyone said that they were an administrator to some degree
-found out that there was no apparent correlation between group roles and learning styles

Group 3:

Group 4:
-road blocks: could not run virtual machnine, had to go to OH, the curating step was delayed
-used python to clean up the data
-there were unrealible responses in the data, only one person said they have taken stat 134 and 135 which is inaccurate
-there was not a significant preferred learning style

Group 5: Our Group 

Group 6:
-Looked at learning style and group role (specically being an administrator) 
-they did not see a trend between learning style and likelihood of being a producer

Group 7:
-looked at learning syles and what classes
-ignored classes besides CS and Stat
-used r to code
-used 6 pair wise t tests to see if there was a relationship between learning styles and classes but did not find any significance
-learned to how to collaborate without meeting in person

Group 8:
-looked at learning styles and known computer languages
-Data Curation: creating libraries, creating functions
-Used Python to clean data but used R to analyze the cleaned data
-Used anova to see relationship but did not see any significance between computer languages and learning styles
-roadblocks: timeline, github, skill sets
