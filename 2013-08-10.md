Presentation Notes:

**Group 1**
... looked at learning styles column and where did you gain experience in programming languages⋅⋅
... used python to clean the data⋅⋅
... used R to fully clean the data so it could be analyzed⋅⋅
... looked at the summary data of learning styles, found out that there does not appear to be a preference of learning style.⋅⋅
... found out that class in interested in collaborative data science⋅⋅
... biggest takeaway: some people are comfortable being specialists and others prefer to be generalists⋅⋅

**Group 2**
-wanted to see how learning styles correlated with group roles
-eliminated students that did not provide their 4 learning scores
-everyone said that they were an administrator to some degree
-found out that there was no apparent correlation between group roles and learning styles

**Group 3**
-used R because they were prepared from stat 133
-used markdown
-are happy about their decision

**Group 4**
-road blocks: could not run virtual machnine, had to go to OH, the curating step was delayed
-used python to clean up the data
-there were unrealible responses in the data, only one person said they have taken stat 134 and 135 which is inaccurate
-there was not a significant preferred learning style

**Group 5**
Our Group 

**Group 6**
-Looked at learning style and group role (specically being an administrator) 
-they did not see a trend between learning style and likelihood of being a producer

**Group 7**
-looked at learning syles and what classes
-ignored classes besides CS and Stat
-used r to code
-used 6 pair wise t tests to see if there was a relationship between learning styles and classes but did not find any significance
-learned to how to collaborate without meeting in person

**Group 8**
-looked at learning styles and known computer languages
-Data Curation: creating libraries, creating functions
-Used Python to clean data but used R to analyze the cleaned data
-Used anova to see relationship but did not see any significance between computer languages and learning styles
-roadblocks: timeline, github, skill sets

**Group 9**
-looked at learning styles in a bar chart, all looked even
-looked at programming languages in a pie chart
-used R to analyze data
-only had 3 members so had a limited timeline

**Group 10**
-used R to analyze data
-made a word cloud for the frequency of known programming languages
-counted languages known per learning type
-tried to look for correlation between number of languages and learning style, group role
-read/write learners are not inclined toward programming
-word cloud is the easiest to understand

**Group 11**
-All had specific roles but worked together
-focused on making their code reproducible
-Looked at career goals, many want to become an actuary
-created a word cloud to look at career goals
