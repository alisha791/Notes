###The Quakers: The Final Quake Presentation

* They have created a model that has a very slightly less area under the curve value than Luen's model
* In order to improve their model, they are considering changing the value of tau by having a lower and upper bound
* The problem with this approach is that having a tau value of .95 would mean that an alarm would be on almost all the time
* Professor stark is saying that you have to make sure to look at the magnitude of the earthquake when turning on an alarm
