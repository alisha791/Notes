###Professor Stark's Presentation

Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms


Do earthquakes really have probabilities?

Rabit Axioms: cant turn a rate into a probability without assuming the pheomeno is random in the first place
cammot conclude tat amount to assumming that the process is ramdom

What would make the casino metaphore apt. 

the physiics of earthquakes might be stochastic
stochastic models might provide a compact accurate description of earthquake phenomenology 

stochastic models might be useful for predicting future sismicity

unless you belive the rabbit theromem says that you cant conclude process os ramdom
might still be useful to treat it as roandom for reason 2 or 3

Common stochastic models for seismicity: possson (does not fit date, much more clusters in real earthquakes), will pass test if your reve enough events but standard algorithims do not work. 
gamma renewel, doesnt fit
ETAS, does not fit, epidemic type aftershocj model

we will focus on several declustering methods on SCEC data, test for temporal and spatoptemporal Posisson behavior.

Physics does not support poisson, data contridicts poisson


Automativ Alarms and MDA's
*Automatic alarm:after every eevent with M>u start an alarm of duration t

*madnitude dependent automatic alatm MDA after every event with M>u starts an alarm of duration tu^M
1 free parameter, u (more clever)

For bth, afjust fraction of time vobered by alams through t
optimal ETAS preictot, level set pf conditional intestnit
ETAS has 4 free parameteres: K, a, c, p

* we will get a lot aof false positives but never false negatives


simulation is generated from a ETAS model, if you use ETAS using 

exciting result: tweek automatic alarm system so that it fits model even better than ETAS


Details of ETAS model:
example: people getting infected, may or may not be infecting any number of other people
Heuristic: some evemts are unpredicatable background, main shocks
some are aftershocks
aftershocks can have aftershocks
two empirical relatiopnships:
*Gutenberg-Ritcher law:power loaw for magnitude/frequency
*Omori-Utsu law:rate of aftershocks decays like power
Magnitude independent of time, same districition for main and aftershocjs
model events above some threshold magnitude m0

Gutenberg-Ritcher law for mafnitudes:
N proportion to 10^(-bM)
best fitting parameter b varies regionally, typically different in aftershock sequennces from overall nest b
Etas turns this into a probability density
p(M|m0) = b ln 10*10^(-b(1-M))


Omuri-Utsue law for aftershcos
deltaN/t = k/(c+t)^p
patammeters K, c, [ cary by mainshocj by region, etc
p<=1 gives infinitely many aftershocks, fitted calue of p ofen <1/
ETAS turn this into a probability density for aftershocks of ith event


Poisson background of events with M>= 0 with constant rate u(M0)

if there is n event at time t , its mafnitude is fraws from the density
mafnitudes are IID

model gets kicked up everytime there is an event

ETAS untangles:

assumes background is Poisson
treats GR and OU rates as if thet were probability distributions
madnitudes are indpendent of everthing else
special case of Hawkes model
can be unstables

How to fit to ETAS model:
ML (maximum likelihood)
implemendted as EM, typically
etas.f

using ETAS to predict:
optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditional intensity
turn on alrmas when the conditional intensit lambda(t) is abve some threshold

we have to be able to estimate model , have to know conditional intensity is at begining of model and how it evolves over time


Goals:
access code from Brad Luen
install ettas.f port etas.f to Python
download data from SCEC
replicate Luen's dissertation results
choose periods for training and for testing our enhanced MDA approach
frame the tuning of MDA as an optimization problem
develop an algorithm to do the tunng
train and test, iterate
document and submit for publication
