##Professor Stark's Presentation

####Magnitude-dependent Automatic Alarms

######Do earthquakes really have probabilities?
* Rabit Axioms: cant turn a rate into a probability without assuming the pheomenon is random in the first place

* The physiics of earthquakes might be stochastic and stochastic models might provide a compact accurate description of earthquake phenomenology 

* stochastic models might be useful for predicting future seismicity

* Common stochastic models for seismicity: poisson (does not fit data, much more clusters in real earthquakes), will pass test if your remove enough events but standard algorithims do not work. gamma renewel, doesnt fit, ETAS, does not fit, (epidemic type aftershock model)

* we will focus on several declustering methods on SCEC data, test for temporal and spatioptemporal Posisson behavior.

* Physics does not support poisson, data contridicts poisson

######Automatic Alarms and MDA's
* Automatic alarm:after every event with M>u start an alarm of duration t

* madnitude dependent automatic alatm MDA after every event with M>u starts an alarm of duration tu^M
1 free parameter, u (more clever)

* we will get a lot af false positives but never false negatives

* simulation is generated from a ETAS model, ETAS has 4 free parameteres: K, a, c, p

* exciting result: tweek automatic alarm system so that it fits model even better than ETAS

######Details of ETAS model:
* example: people getting infected, may or may not be infecting any number of other people
* Heuristic: some evemts are unpredicatable background, main shocks
* some are aftershocks
* aftershocks can have aftershocks
* two empirical relatiopnships:
* Gutenberg-Ritcher law: power law for magnitude/frequency
* Omori-Utsu law: rate of aftershocks decays like power
* Magnitude independent of time, same distinction for main and aftershocks
* model events above some threshold magnitude m0

######Gutenberg-Ritcher law for magnitudes:
* N proportion to 10^(-bM)
* best fitting parameter b varies regionally, typically different in aftershock sequennces from overall nest b
* Etas turns this into a probability density
p(M|m0) = b ln 10*10^(-b(1-M))


######Omuri-Utsue law for aftershocks
* deltaN/t = k/(c+t)^p
* patammeters K, c, [ cary by mainshocj by region, etc
* p<=1 gives infinitely many aftershocks, fitted value of p often <1/
* ETAS turns this into a probability density for aftershocks of ith event
* Poisson background of events with M>= 0 with constant rate u(M0)
* if there is n events at time t , its magnitude is fraws from the density
mafnitudes are IID
* model gets kicked up everytime there is an event

######ETAS untangled:
* assumes background is Poisson
* treats GR and OU rates as if thet were probability distributions
* madnitudes are indpendent of everthing else
* special case of Hawkes model
* can be unstable

######How to fit to ETAS model:
* ML (maximum likelihood)
* implemendted as EM, typically
* etas.f

######using ETAS to predict:
* optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditional intensity
* turn on alrmas when the conditional intensit lambda(t) is abve some threshold
* we have to be able to estimate model, have to know conditional intensity is at begining of model and how it evolves over time

######Goals:
* access code from Brad Luen
* install ettas.f port etas.f to Python
* download data from SCEC
* replicate Luen's dissertation results
* choose periods for training and for testing our enhanced MDA approach
* frame the tuning of MDA as an optimization problem
* develop an algorithm to do the tunng
* train and test, iterate
* document and submit for publication
